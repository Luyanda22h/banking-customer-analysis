# Exploratory Analysis of Retail Banking Transactions

## Executive Summary
This project uses Python-based data analysis techniques to explore customer financial behaviour in a retail banking context. The analysis focuses on the relationship between income, monthly spending, and credit risk indicators to support business and risk-related decision-making.

## Objectives
- Examine the relationship between customer income and monthly spending.
- Compare financial behaviour across different account types.
- Assess whether credit score influences customer spending behaviour.

## Tools 
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Insights
- A moderate positive relationship exists between monthly income and spending; however, spending behaviour varies widely among customers.
- High income does not necessarily correspond to high spending, indicating the presence of distinct customer segments.
- Credit score shows no strong relationship with monthly spending, suggesting that creditworthiness and spending behaviour capture different aspects of customer profiles.

## Business Implications
- Customer segmentation based on income and spending can support targeted product offerings.
- Customers with high spending relative to income may require closer credit monitoring.
- High-income, low-spend customers represent potential targets for savings and investment products.
